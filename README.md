# Coral Island Save Editor
This is a fork of  https://github.com/na-ji/coral-save-editor/
- This is updated to the latest update and has feature to remove players, but if a player gets removed, some of his items that he did put down will get removed, so be careful about chests etc
- Added a feature to re-sort / import / export player data and change steam_id
Changing Steam ID to the new person that's joining would keep the previous progress of the old player.
